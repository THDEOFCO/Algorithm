input positive number k,find all numbers x>=y,let 1/k=1/x+1/y.

input 
2
12

output
2
1/2 = 1/6 + 1/3
1/2 = 1/4 + 1/4
8
1/12 =1/156 + 1/13
1/12 =1/84 + 1/14
1/12 =1/60+ 1/15
1/12 =1/48 + 1/16
1/12 =1/36 + 1/18
1/12 =1/30 + 1/20
1/12 =1/28 + 1/21
1/12 =1/24 + 1/24

Analyze
the  x is form 2k to (k+1)*k,and the y from k+1 to 2k;find the ranges,then enumerate the suitable situation,this problem is easy.
but when I realize this code ,I meet three problems.
First,because of the output,I need count the number of fitting the equation,then put out it,but when I meet a fitable situation 
I should output the equation at once,that means,one need store,then output,one need output at once.
so I ues double for regulations,maybe it is complex,but I haven't a better way.
Second,when I first run the code , it print all equation,I mean ,the code doesn't judge the fitable situations,then I realize the fraction
1/2 is equal 0,so I correct the fraction,1.0/2.
third,the first example can run successfully by my correcting,but when it come to the second example,it has reduced three situations.
just output five,I can't solve this problem

My code

include<stdio.h>
int main(){
 int k;
 int count=0;
 while(scanf("%d",&k)==1&&k){

for(int i=k+1;i<=2*k;i++)
    for(int j=(k+1)*k;j>=2*k;j--)
    if(1.0/k==1.0/j+1.0/i){
    count++;
    break;}
    printf("%d\n",count);
    
for(int i=k+1;i<=2*k;i++)
    for(int j=(k+1)*k;j>=2*k;j--)
    if(1.0/k==1.0/j+1.0/i){
    printf("1/%d = 1/%d + 1/%d\n",k,j,i);break;}
	
 }
 return 0;
	}

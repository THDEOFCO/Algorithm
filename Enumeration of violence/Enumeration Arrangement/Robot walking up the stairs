there is a square of x*y, a robot only can walk to right or down,from the upper left corner to the upper right corner.
pleace create an algorithm to count the ways of robot.
please input two positive interge numbers x,y,output the counts,guarantee x+y<=12.


Analyze
this idea is from small to large,from specific to normal.
for example ,when x=y=1,there is one way,when x=1,y=2,the count is one,when x=2,y=1,the count is one as well
then we can see,if x or y equal one ,there is always one way,because the robot only can walk to right or down.
when x=y=2,it equal 1+1.then we can get a regulration,then we can write the code

int walk(int x,int y){

if(x==1||y==1)return 1;
else
return  walk((x-1),y)+walk(x,(y-1));

}

Summeray
I think this idea is very important,from small to large ,from specific to normal.analyze the small number
find the regularation.if I haven't the process of analyse,I  promise I can't write the simple code

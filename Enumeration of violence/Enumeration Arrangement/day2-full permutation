try to creat permutation 1~n

in this section,I meet the first diffluct knowledge in Algorithm, Maybe I can understand the idea about dfs
but I can't writte code by myself or can't understnd why code wrrited like this.
the follwing is code about realize permuttation in the book

void print_permutation(int n,int *a,int cur){

 if(cur==n){
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)printf("%d",a[i]);
    printf("\n");}
    
 else for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    int ok=1;
    for(int j=0;j<cur;j++)
        if(a[j]==i) ok=0;
    if(ok){
        a[cur]=i;
        print_permutation(n,a,cur+1);}
 }

 }
 
 the idea I understand is that put them in stack,for example,print_permutation(3,a,0).
 you can gain a[0]=1;then call the funcion,but last step hasn't finish,so all the information
 is put in stack,then the program continue,just like the preorder traveral of a tree.
 
 the one of application of dfs is backtracking,now let us see the classic problem named Eight Queen
